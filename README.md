# 4430-Game-Project

## Requirements
Make sure you have installed:
- git
- Unreal Engine 4.27.2

Optionally:
- GitHub Desktop (for managing git)

## Installation
Navigate to a folder where you want to clone the repo.

Clone this repo using
```
git clone https://github.com/WindowsVista42/UNT_4430_Project
```

Download assets from the google drive folder:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12iX2HfDrVGjF9TBiPESkim1tVJB4bzTj?usp=sharing

Extract the .zip file you just downloaded

In a new file explorer window, navigate to where you cloned the git repo.

Copy `Content/` (located in the extracted .zip folder in the UNT_4430_Project folder) into the git repo folder.

Launch Unreal Engine 4.27.2

In the "Select or Create New Project" window under "Recent Projects" click "More"

Click "Browse"

Navigate to the folder where you cloned the git repo.

Open the folder and click "UNT_4430_Project.uproject"

Click "Open"

Unreal Engine should now tell you some files are missing and will prompt you to rebuild the files.
Click "Yes".

Wait for Unreal Engine to rebuild the files, this might take a while (it has to copy a lot of data to disk).

Once Unreal Engine opens, you should be able to click "Play" and the project should run.
