- GitHub Desktop (for managing git)

## Setup
1. Navigate to a folder where you want to clone the repo.

2. Clone the repo using (on the command line)  
```
git clone https://github.com/WindowsVista42/UNT_4430_Project
```  

3. Download assets from the google drive folder:  
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12iX2HfDrVGjF9TBiPESkim1tVJB4bzTj?usp=sharing

4. Extract the .zip file you just downloaded

5. In a new file explorer window, navigate to where you cloned the git repo.

6. Copy "Content" into the git repo folder. "Content" is located in the extracted .zip folder in the "UNT_4430_Project" folder.

7. Launch Unreal Engine 4.27.2

8. In the "Select or Create New Project" window under "Recent Projects" click "More"

9. Click "Browse"

10. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the git repo.

11. Open the folder and click "UNT_4430_Project.uproject"

12. Click "Open"

13. Unreal Engine should now tell you some files are missing and will prompt you to rebuild the files.  
Click "Yes".

14. Wait for Unreal Engine to rebuild the files, this might take a while (it has to copy a lot of data to disk).

15. Once Unreal Engine opens, you should be able to click "Play" and the project should run.
